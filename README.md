# MindMap Project

## Setup
1. Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your local machine. You can download the latest build here:  https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
2. Go to the mindmap directory and execute `npx expo start` in your terminal. You should notice a scannable QR code will appear. We're using expo rather than the CLI since native code for iOS cannot run on Linux.
3. Downlaod the Expo Go app on your iPhone.
4. Scan the QR code generated by the `start` command. It should take you to the Expo Go app, and the app should be visible. You may need to try this again if it bugs out the first time.
5. Follow the guide created by the `start` command you executed earlier. Most importantly, note that after you edit code, you can press `r` to refresh it onto your phone.
